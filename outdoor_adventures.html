        <div class=""><h1>ROCK CLIMBING</h1>
        <h2>THE CAPE ROUTES APOSTLES</h2>
          <p>The icons od Camps Bay, there is more climbing to be done here than Lion's Head and Table Mountain combined, but with no cable car. Approaches starting at 45 minutes and west facing these buttresses get less traffic than they should. If you are looking to escape the crowds od Table Mountain and Lions, meander down the pipe track and prepare for many adventures.</p>

        <h2>LION'S HEAD</h2>
          <p>There are two crags on Lion's Head, one is 'Granite' and the other is 'Sandstone'. The Sandstone climbing is on the cocentic rings of rock at the top of the mountain (the Lion's Head part), while the Granite climbing is on the huge huguenot slab, a short distance above the houses of Fresnaye/Bantry Bay and facing the sea and Robben Island. There are some single pitch sport routes on the Granite, but mostly they are multi-pitch trad routes. climbing on Sandstone is all trad, with a mix if single pitch and multi-ptch routes, depending on the band, ledges, vegetation and rock quality. The walk-in to the Granite is about 15 minutes and the Sandstone is about 25 minutes.</p>

        <h2>BAINS KLOOF</h2>
          <p>From Wellington one has to drive over the pass and some way down the other side towards Woleseley. The best routes are on the imposing crag that is on the south side of the valley. Park at the appropriate siding on the pass and descend to the river. A long walk up to base of the crag leads on into a nice cave.</p>

        <h2>TOWERKOP</h2>
          <p>Towerkop stands on a few km west of Ladysmith(Cape) on the Laingsburg road. Towerkop will get more winter rain. The caves seep badly a few days after heavy rain. Summers are hot in the sun, but quite cool in the shade. More than 100 traditional routes, there are no bolts at all. This is not sport area & no bolts what so ever should be placed. This is a situation where there are bad men who will do something. There are numerous sport lines at Waterkloof, Outshoorn and Montagu, all not far apart. </p></div>

        <div class=""><h1>HIKING</h1>
        <h2>SKELETON GORGE</h2>
          <p>Known for it's popularity amoung loclas and tourists, Skeleton Gorge is a scenic trek not rivalled by many. Ideal in dry conditions, this hike is great for both thr seasoned and novice hikers. During the summer months you'll be able to get some shade along the afromontane forest nearly all the way up Skeleton Gorge. Bear in mind that this hike can be quite strenous so be prepared to really work those muscles, and take the necessary safety precuations.</p>
        <h3>Difficulty:</h3>
          <p>Monderate</p>

         <h2>LION'S HEAD</h2>
          <p>This short summit offers panoramic views of 'CPT' and unbeatable sunsets. It's a popular route to do on nights where there's a full moon. If you're relatively fit, you'll find yourself at the top quite quickly, which is why it's such a popular after-work hike. There's a little bit of climbing involved, but there are handholds and chains to help you on your way up and down. You can also take the roundabout way, which skips the climbing part if you are walking with small children or dogs.</p>
        <h3>Difficulty:</h3>
          <p>Moderate</p>

         <h1>SUICED GORGE</h1>
          <p>Not one for the fainthearted, this is an extreme hike with very high jumps down the river into the pools below. We recommend doing this with a guide as it can be dangerous.</p>
         <h3>Difficulty:</h3>
          <p>Difficult</p>

         <h1>KROM RIVER</h1>
          <p>Save this one for summer as the path leads up a river to two spectacular rock pools, which can be icy even when it's warm. The walk itself isn't too long, so you can spend plenty of time swimming in the mountain pools.</p>
        <h3>Difficulty:</h3>
          <p>Difficult</p></div>
